# React Server Side Rending Demo

To get the app up and running, first treat like any create react app project.

```shell
yarn install
yarn start
```

To demonstrate server side rendering

```shell
yarn build
yarn start:ssr
```

The `yarn build` builds your site for production and puts it in the `build/` directory.

The `yarn start:ssr` starts up an express server that serves the files in the `build/` directory.

Then visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
